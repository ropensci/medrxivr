\description{
[Available for medRxiv only] This function allows users to import
  a maintained static snapshot of the medRxiv repository, instead of downloading
  a copy from the API, which can become unavailable during peak usage times.
  The function dynamically retrieves multiple snapshot parts from the specified
  repository and combines them into a single dataframe.
