<!-- badges: end -->

An increasingly important source of health-related bibliographic content
are preprints - preliminary versions of research articles that have yet
to undergo peer review. The two preprint repositories most relevant to
health-related sciences are [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) and
[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/), both of which are operated by the
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

The goal of the `medrxivr` R package is two-fold. In the first instance,
it provides programmatic access to the [Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory
(CSHL) API](https://api.biorxiv.org/), allowing users to easily download
medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint metadata (e.g. title, abstract, publication
date, author list, etc) into R. The package also provides access to a
maintained static snapshot of the medRxiv repository (see [Data
sources](#medrxiv-data)). Secondly, `medrxivr` provides functions to
search the downloaded preprint records using regular expressions and
Boolean logic, as well as helper functions that allow users to export
their search results to a .BIB file for easy import to a reference
manager and to download the full-text PDFs of preprints matching their
search criteria.

## Installation

To install the stable version of the package from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("medrxivr")
library(medrxivr)
```

Alternatively, to install the development version from GitHub, use the
following code:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/medrxivr")
library(medrxivr)
```

## Data sources

### medRxiv data

`medrixvr` provides two ways to access medRxiv data:

- `mx_api_content(server = "medrxiv")` creates a local copy of all data
  available from the medRxiv API at the time the function is run.

``` r
# Get a copy of the database from the live medRxiv API endpoint
preprint_data <- mx_api_content()  
```

- `mx_snapshot()` provides access to a static snapshot of the medRxiv
  database. The snapshot is created each morning at 6am using
  `mx_api_content()` and is stored as CSV file in the [medrxivr-data
  repository](https://github.com/mcguinlu/medrxivr-data). This method
  does not rely on the API (which can become unavailable during peak
  usage times) and is usually faster (as it reads data from a CSV rather
  than having to re-extract it from the API). Discrepancies between the
  most recent static snapshot and the live database can be assessed
  using `mx_crosscheck()`.

``` r
# Get a copy of the database from the daily snapshot
preprint_data <- mx_snapshot()  
```

The relationship between the two methods for the medRxiv database is
summarised in the figure below:

### bioRxiv data

Only one data source exists for the bioRxiv repository:

- `mx_api_content(server = "biorxiv")` creates a local copy of all data
  available from the bioRxiv API endpoint at the time the function is
  run. **Note**: due to it’s size, downloading a complete copy of the
  bioRxiv repository in this manner takes a long time (~ 1 hour).

``` r
# Get a copy of the database from the live bioRxiv API endpoint
preprint_data <- mx_api_content(server = "biorxiv")
```

## Performing your search

Once you have created a local copy of either the medRxiv or bioRxiv
preprint database, you can pass this object (`preprint_data` in the
examples above) to `mx_search()` to search the preprint records using an
advanced search strategy.

``` r
# Import the medrxiv database
preprint_data <- mx_snapshot()
#> Using medRxiv snapshot - 2022-07-06 01:09

# Perform a simple search
results <- mx_search(data = preprint_data,
                     query ="dementia")
#> Found 427 record(s) matching your search.

# Perform an advanced search
topic1  <- c("dementia","vascular","alzheimer's")  # Combined with Boolean OR
topic2  <- c("lipids","statins","cholesterol")     # Combined with Boolean OR
myquery <- list(topic1, topic2)                    # Combined with Boolean AND

results <- mx_search(data = preprint_data,
                     query = myquery)
#> Found 143 record(s) matching your search.
```

You can also explore which search terms are contributing most to your
search by setting `report = TRUE`:

``` r
results <- mx_search(data = preprint_data,
                     query = myquery,
                     report = TRUE)
#> Found 143 record(s) matching your search.
#> Total topic 1 records: 2272
#> dementia: 427
#> vascular: 1918
#> alzheimer's: 0
#> Total topic 2 records: 410
#> lipids: 157
#> statins: 61
#> cholesterol: 255
```

## Further functionality

### Export records identified by your search to a .BIB file

Pass the results of your search above (the `results` object) to the
`mx_export()` to export references for preprints matching your search
results to a .BIB file so that they can be easily imported into a
reference manager (e.g. Zotero, Mendeley).

``` r
mx_export(data = results,
          file = "mx_search_results.bib")
```

### Download PDFs for records returned by your search

Pass the results of your search above (the `results` object) to the
`mx_download()` function to download a copy of the PDF for each record
found by your search.

``` r
mx_download(results,        # Object returned by mx_search(), above
            "pdf/",         # Directory to save PDFs to 
            create = TRUE)  # Create the directory if it doesn't exist
```

## Accessing the raw API data

By default, the `mx_api_*()` functions clean the data returned by the
API for use with other `medrxivr` functions.

To access the raw data returned by the API, the `clean` argument should
set to `FALSE`:

``` r
mx_api_content(to_date = "2019-07-01", clean = FALSE)
```

article](https://docs.ropensci.org/medrxivr/articles/medrxiv-api.html#accessing-the-raw-api-data)

## Other tools/packages for working with medRxiv/bioRxiv data

The focus of `medrxivr` is on providing tools to allow users to import
and then search medRxiv and bioRxiv data. Below are a list of
complementary packages that provide distinct but related functionality
when working with medRxiv and bioRxiv data:

- [`rbiorxiv`](https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/rbiorxiv) by [Nicholas
  Fraser](https://github.com/nicholasmfraser) provides access to the
  same medRxiv and bioRxiv *content* data as `medrxivr`, but also
  provides access to the *usage* data (e.g. downloads per month) that
  the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory API offers. This is useful if you
  wish to explore, for example, [how the number of PDF downloads from
  bioRxiv has grown over
  time.](https://github.com/nicholasmfraser/rbiorxiv#pdf-downloads-over-time)
